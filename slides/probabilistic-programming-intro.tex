\textbf{Why you might want to use probabilistic programming}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \keywd{Customization} - We can create models that have built-in hypothesis tests
 \item \keywd{Propagation of uncertainty} - There is a degree of belief associated prediction and estimation
 \item \keywd{Intuition} - The models are essentially 'white-box' which provides insight into our data
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Why you might \highlt{NOT} want use out probabilistic programming}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \keywd{Deep dive} - Many of the online examples will assume a fairly deep understanding of statistics
 \item \keywd{Overhead} - Computational overhead might make it difficult to be production ready
 \item \keywd{Sometimes simple is enough} - The ability to customize models in almost a plug-n-play manner has to come with some cost.

You are a skilled programmer, but bugs still slip into your code. After a particularly difficult implementation of an algorithm, you decide to test your code on a trivial example. It passes. You test the code on a harder problem. It passes once again. And it passes the next, \textit{even more difficult}, test too! You are \highlt{starting to believe} that there may be no bugs in this code...

\begin{block}{Probabilistic model}
A joint distribution $p(X, \theta)$ of data $X$ and latent variables $\theta$.

\begin{equation}
P(\theta|x) = \frac{P(x|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(x)}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \keywd{Prior} - $P(\theta)$ - one's beliefs about a quantity before presented with evidence
 \item \keywd{Posterior} - $P(\theta|x)$ - probability of the parameters given the evidence
 \item \keywd{Likelihood} - $P(x|\theta)$  - probability of the evidence given the parameters
 \item \keywd{Normalizing constant} - $P(x)$
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
 \item $P(\theta)$: This big, complex code likely has a bug in it. 
 \item $P(\theta|X)$: The code passed all X tests; there still might be a bug, but it is less likely now.

\frametitle{Bayesian Linear Regression}
\scriptsize
For a set of $N$ data points $(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y})=\{(\mathbf{x}_n, y_n)\}$, the model can be specified as follows: 

\begin{align}
 p(\mathbf{w})                         &= Normal(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{0},\sigma_{w}^{2} \mathbf{I})\\
 p(b)                                  &= Normal(b|0,\sigma^{2}_{b}) \\
 p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{w},b,\mathbf{X}) &= \prod^{N}_{n=1} Normal(y_{n}|\mathbf{x}_{n}^{T} \mathbf{w} + b,\sigma^{2}_{y})
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}
 \item The latent variables are the linear model’s weights $\mathbf{w}$ and intercept $\mathbf{b}$
 \item We assume the prior and likelihood variances are known: $\sigma_{w}^{2}$, $\sigma_{b}^{2}$ and $\sigma^{2}_{y}$
 \item The mean of the likelihood is given by a linear transformation of the inputs in $\mathbf{x}_{n}$

\frametitle{Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)}
\footnotesize
\keywd{MCMC}
\begin{itemize}
 \item It is a family of algorithms for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is difficult.
 \item The sequence can then be used to approximate the distribution
 \item It allows for inference on complex models
\end{itemize}

A particularly useful class of MCMC, known as Hamliltonian Monte Carlo, requires \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient}{gradient} information which is often not readily available so PyMC3 uses Theano to get around this problem.  Something that has recently made this whole field a lot more interesting is the No-U-turn sampler (NUTS) because there are \highlt{self-tuning strategies} \citep{Hoffman14}.
\\ \ \\
One of the really nice things about probabilistic programming is that \highlt{you do not have to know how inference is performed}, but it can be useful.

  Analyze the degree to which data generated from the model deviate from data generated from the true distribution. Can by used for hypothesis testing, model comparison, model selection, model averaging and to validate test data.

We can never validate whether a model is true.

Posterior predictive checks (PPCs) analyze the degree to which data generated from the model deviate

\begin{block}{}
 Another way of thinking about this: unlike a traditional program, which only runs in the forward directions, \highlt{a probabilistic program is run in both the forward and backward direction}. It runs forward to compute the consequences of the assumptions it contains about the world (i.e., the model space it represents), but it also runs backward from the data to constrain the possible explanations. In practice, many probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave these forward and backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.
