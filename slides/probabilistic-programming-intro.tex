\frametitle{Probabilistic programming}
\footnotesize
\begin{block}{A probabilistic programming language makes it easy to:}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item write out complex probability models
  \item And subsequently solve these models automatically.
 \end{enumerate}
 \end{block}

\begin{block}{Generally this is accomplished by:}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Random variables are handled as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\_primitive}{primitive}
  \item Inference is handled behind the scenes
  \item Memory and processor management is abstracted away
 \end{enumerate}
 \end{block} 
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{ 
\frametitle{The pros and the cons}
\footnotesize
\textbf{Why you might want to use probabilistic programming}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \keywd{Customization} - We can create models that have built-in hypothesis tests
 \item \keywd{Propagation of uncertainty} - There is a degree of belief associated prediction and estimation
 \item \keywd{Intuition} - The models are essentially 'white-box' which provides insight into our data
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Why you might \highlt{NOT} want use out probabilistic programming}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \keywd{Deep dive} - Many of the online examples will assume a fairly deep understanding of statistics
 \item \keywd{Overhead} - Computational overhead might make it difficult to be production ready
 \item \keywd{Sometimes simple is enough} - The ability to customize models in almost a plug-n-play manner has to come with some cost. 
\end{enumerate}

% \begin{itemize}

%  \item $P(X=x) = P(\{s\in S : X(s) = x\})$
%  \item $X \sim XYZ(\alpha, \beta)$ means $X$ is distributed as, $XYZ$ with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$
